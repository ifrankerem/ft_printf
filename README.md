# ft_printf

This **42 School** project involves re-implementing the standard `printf` function in C, supporting various format specifiers (`cspdiuxX%`). The goal is to develop a flexible and efficient custom function, `ft_printf`, that mimics the behavior of the original while ensuring clean memory management and robust variadic argument handling.
